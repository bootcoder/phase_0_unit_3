## Release 5: Reflection


The most challenging part of this challenge was figuring out how to get the Flippen imgs to display on GitHub
I'm using grab which saves as .tiff turns out there is no real way to display .tiff in GitHub md
Convert to .jpg Move Along. There's 45 minutes I'll never get back.
